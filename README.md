# Climate Analysis and Flask API

# Project Overview
This project performs climate analysis on weather data from Hawaii using SQLAlchemy and Flask. The analysis is divided into two main parts:

1. Data Analysis: Conducted in a Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and generate visualizations.
2. Flask API: Provides endpoints to serve the analyzed data in JSON format.

# Findings

1. Queried the most recent date in the dataset, which is 8/23/2017.

# Findings from Precipitation Analysis:
1. The precipitation data showed variations throughout the year with some months having significantly higher precipitation.
Summary statistics provided insights into the average, minimum, and maximum precipitation levels.
# Findings from Station Analysis:
1.Queried to find the number of stations, which is 9.
2. The most active station (USC00519281) had the highest number of temperature observations.
Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed climate data from Hawaii and provided a Flask API to serve the results. The analysis revealed important insights about precipitation patterns and temperature observations, and the Flask API enables easy access to this data through various endpoints.
